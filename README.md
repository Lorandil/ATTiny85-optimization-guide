# ATTiny85 optimization guide
 Just a collection of my experiences and thoughts about code optimization on an ATtiny85 in C/C++
 
# Where is the guide?
 For now the guide comes disguised as a header file https://github.com/Lorandil/ATTiny85-optimization-guide/blob/main/attiny_code_optimization_guide.h.
 I'm unsure if I will integrate it into this README.md or ... suggestions are welcome ;)
